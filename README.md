Employers can post job listings and pay the designated salary upfront, which is held by the admin. A small service fee is deducted, and the remaining amount is allocated to the hired employee. Job seekers can explore and apply for suitable positions through a user-friendly interface. This structured payment system ensures a seamless and efficient hiring process.
