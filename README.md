Part-Time Job Portal

Overview

The Part-Time Job Portal is a profit-driven web platform created to link employers with individuals seeking part-time employment opportunities. This platform allows employers to easily post job listings. At the same time, job seekers can explore various available positions that fit their schedules. They can also apply for these jobs directly through the user-friendly application provided by the site.
Employers have the convenience of paying the selected salary within a time limit upon posting their job details. This payment goes to an account managed by the admin of the portal. A small portion of this payment is deducted as profit for the service provided. The remaining amount is then allocated to the employee who gets hired. This straightforward payment structure ensures that both employers and employees benefit from the process, simplifying the transactional nature of part-time hiring.
